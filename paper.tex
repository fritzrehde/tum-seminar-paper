% Abstract: Brief summary of area, problem, approach, key result


% - what are programming types in general?
% - why do we need ownership types, what do they do?

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Introduction: introduce area, problem, approach, key results, contributions, outline


\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
% Background: if needed, describe prerequisites

\subsection{Memory Safety}

Definition of memory safety\cite{memory1}.
Why memory safery is important\cite{nsa-memory-safety}.


\subsection{History of Ownership Types}

% - when/in which language first introduced?
% - why slow adoption?

\subsection{Implementation in Rust}
% - borrow checker

Notes from rust-book\cite{rust-book}.
Ownership definition: set of rules that govern how Rust program manages memory
Compiler checks rules, if violated program doesn't compile
Purpose of Rust ownership is to mainly manage heap data
Ownership rules:
- each value in Rust has an owner
- there can only be one owner at a time
- when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped (value is valid in scope, invalid out of scope)
Definition scope:
```
{                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
    let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

data types of known size at compile time (int, float, bool, char): stored on stack, popped off stack when out of scope, quickly and trivially copied


\subsection{Practical examples using Rust}
% - show common Rust ownership errors
% - Protection against memory vulnerabilitie examples


\subsection{Alternatives}
% - comparison to alternative type systems without ownership (C/C++: none at all, Java: garbage collection)
% - choose non-ownership programming language e.g. C++20
% - compare code examples
% - compile time differences between Rust and non-ownership lang
% - runtime differences between Rust and non-ownership lang
